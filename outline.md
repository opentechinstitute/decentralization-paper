# Decentralization outline
* Introduction - Brief explanation of centralization and undoing it
* What is decentralization?
  * History - how did we get centralized and why
  * What is the opposite of centralization
  * The types of decentralization
    * Federation/interconnection and open protocols
    * Blockchain
    * Generalized computing/p2p communications
* Policy Importance
    * Disruption and innovation
    * Competition enhancing
    * Privacy without regulation
    * Encryption vital
    * Cybersecurity in some ways but not oversold
    * Control over data brings other benefits
* Policy Opportunities
    * Internet today is focused on consumers and servers
    * Everyone is a server in decentralization
    * Upload speed vs. download speed
    * Ownership of devices and right to repair
    * Unlicensed spectrum
    * Ability for devices to connect directly to one another (securely) instead of needing the internet
    * Work @ the IETF and other standards bodies to advance open, secure, interoperable standards rather than walled gardens.


# Thoughts below
* What is decentralization?
* 
* What is dangerous about centralization?
  * Privacy
  * Monocultures and security
  * Lack of power over data
  * E.g. - What if Google decided tomorrow to take everyone's data? See also Photobucket's change to ToS.
* Federation vs walled gardens
  * Encourages competition by allowing easy switching
  * Also by removing barriers to entry - Easier to compete if your new product works with competitors, but is better in some way
* Blockchain coupled with attached IPFS, etc
  * Why is the lack of trust important?
  * Content-based vs Location-based addressing
  * What does it enable?
  * How does it have the capacity to disrupt everything - Compare Alexandria to Spotify/Soundcloud, Akasha to Facebook 
* The future of generalized computing and peer to peer phone communications
  * Everyone hates latency, and the speed of light isn't going anywhere
  * Solution is to locate data as close as possible to user
  * Nothing closer than people in the same room/same campus/same neighborhood
  * Same time, so-called phones are really just general computing devices, mostly running linux or bsd
  * Battery life is improving
  * Phones talking to their neighbors to get data popular data, exchange messages (either private or as a social media feed), or even just play games or other social activities
  * Add in the million sensors that make up the coming IoT space
  * Opportunity for a LOT of rich interaction through published APIs that let devices share knowledge with either everyone or authenticated people without the need for a "cloud service"
  * Secure Scuttlebutt, IPFS, Dat all belong here
  
  
* Funding
  * Most of this is open source and, aside from ICOs which are suspect and often a fraud, without any kind of established funding stream
  
* Random resources
