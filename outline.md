# Decentralization outline



# Thoughts below
* What is dangerous about centralization?
  * Privacy
  * Monocultures and security
  * Lack of power over data
  * E.g. - What if Google decided tomorrow to take everyone's data? See also Photobucket's change to ToS.
* Federation vs walled gardens
  * Encourages competition by allowing easy switching
  * Also by removing barriers to entry - Easier to compete if your new product works with competitors, but is better in some way
* Blockchain coupled with attached IPFS, etc
  * Why is the lack of trust important?
  * What does it enable?
  * How does it have the capacity to disrupt everything - Compare Alexandria to Spotify/Soundcloud, Akasha to Facebook
